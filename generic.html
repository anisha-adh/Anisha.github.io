									<li><b>Earthquake Early Warning System</b></li><p>
										Three major parts: data collection, Visualization, and post-processing. I contributed to the data collection and visualization part. I designed a PCB for the IOT module using KiCAD. ESP-32 and the sensor(Gyrometer) were used for part of the data collection. Another team contributed to the Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) and Machine Learning  model for signal processing. Another use case of this project was the "A System of Vehicular Motion Sensing and Data Acquisition over Thapathali–Kupondole Bridge and Impact Prediction and Analysis Using Machine Learning" project.
									</p>
									<li><b>IOT Controlled Energy Harvesting from Keratin Waste</b></li>
									<p> This is a part of my major project and I contributed on the part of planning, development, IOT, and software development. We used Arduino(Arduino Mega 2560 Pinout and Arduino with BTS 7690), relay switch, 
										contact switches, blades and rods, AC Motor, and the concepts of mechatronics. This project was able to win recognition and support, 
										including a grant from the prestigious Nepal Academy of Science and Technology. Encouraging my team, we established a startup and 
										embarked on a journey to make our project commercially viable. This project was the foundation of our first social enterprise, 
										“InnovateX Multipurpose Pvt. Ltd” as an undergraduate student, helping me develop my managerial skills as well. As part of the startup, we 
										expanded our focus and ventured into developing an e-commerce platform ‘Danfe’ and a meme social networking platform ‘Kabadi’. </p>
									<li><b>Mushoor Home Harvest System</b></li>
									<p>
										This is a climate-controlled device which can maintain temperature, humidity, and air circulation inside a closed container. The module comprises two major parts: The controller box and the container itself. The controller takes input of temperature, humidity and soil  moisture  from multiple sensors inside the container and actuates heater and humidifier based on the feedback.Inside the box there are multiple racks on four levels for putting trays where the mushrooms can be grown. As per calculated this box consumes on average of 130W of energy. We have used 40mm thick Sandwitch(PUF panel) to construct the outer cover of box.
										 Firstly it includes the basic IOT features like remote monitoring and controlling of its parameters like temperature, humidity, etc. This is not only limited to just monitoring using a remote mobile device but in order to get optimal production, users are constantly provided with firmware updates which can be installed with just one click. These updates are equipped with latest research data from the academic research institutions who are constantly engaged into the study of better productivity of mushrooms. This way, we link top mushroom scientists with the local farmers directly. We take the data directly from our research module installed and apply machine learning to learn what is 
												the best scenario for which type of mushroom and send the OTA updates directly to the end users.</li>
  											
										 

									</p>
									<li><b>Magic Mirror</b></li><p>
										The time, weather, calendar, news, and social media updates are all displayed on a smart mirror, commonly referred to as a magic mirror.
										 The magic is created by placing a transparent mirror over a screen such as a monitor. Voice recognition by AVS SDK is paired with a Raspberry Pi or Windows PC to power the system. Everything was controlled by Raspberry Pi.
