									<li><b>Earthquake Early Warning System</b></li><p>
										There are three major parts of this project: data collection, Visualization, and post-processing. I contributed to the data collection and visualization part. I designed a PCB for the IOT module using KiCAD. ESP-32 and the sensor(Gyrometer) were used for part of the data collection. Another team contributed to the Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) and Machine Learning  model for signal processing. Another use case of this project was the "A System of Vehicular Motion Sensing and Data Acquisition over Thapathali–Kupondole Bridge and Impact Prediction and Analysis Using Machine Learning" project.
									</p>
									<li><b>IOT Controlled Energy Harvesting from Keratin Waste</b></li>
									<p> This is my major project and I contributed on the part of planning, development, IOT, and software development. We used Arduino(Arduino Mega 2560 Pinout and Arduino with BTS 7690), relay switch, 
										contact switches, blades and rods, AC Motor, and the concepts of mechatronics. This project was able to win recognition and support, 
										including a grant from the prestigious Nepal Academy of Science and Technology. Encouraging my team, we established a startup and 
										embarked on a journey to make our project commercially viable. This project was the foundation of our first social enterprise, 
										“InnovateX Multipurpose Pvt. Ltd” as an undergraduate student, helping me develop my managerial skills as well. As part of the startup, we 
										expanded our focus and ventured into developing an e-commerce platform ‘Danfe’ and a meme social networking platform ‘Kabadi’. </p>
									<li><b>Mushoor Home Harvest System</b></li>
									<p>
										This is a climate-controlled device which can maintain temperature, humidity, and air circulation inside a closed container. The module comprises two major parts: The controller box and the container itself. 
										The controller takes input of temperature, humidity, and soil  moisture  from multiple sensors inside the container and actuates the heater and humidifier based on the feedback. Inside the box, there are multiple racks 
										on four levels for putting trays where the mushrooms can be grown. As calculated, this box consumes an average of 130W of energy. We have used a 40mm thick Sandwich (PUF panel) to construct the outer cover of the box.
										 Firstly it includes the basic IOT features like remote monitoring and controlling of its parameters like temperature, humidity, etc.  
										</li>
									</p>
									<li><b>Magic Mirror</b></li><p>
										The time, weather, calendar, news, and social media updates are all displayed on a smart mirror, commonly referred to as a magic mirror.
										 The magic is created by placing a transparent mirror over a screen such as a monitor. Voice recognition by AVS SDK is paired with a Raspberry Pi or Windows PC to power the system. Everything was controlled by Raspberry Pi.
